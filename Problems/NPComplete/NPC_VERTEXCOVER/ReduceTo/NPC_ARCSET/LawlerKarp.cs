    private string _reductionDefinition = @"This Reduction is an implementation of Lawler and Karp's reduction as laid out in Karp's 21 NP_Complete Problems. 
                                            It takes an instance of an undirected graph (specifically an instance of VERTEXCOVER) and returns an instance of ARCSET (ie. a Directed Graph)
                                            Specifically, a reduction follows the following algorithm: 
                                            For an undirected graph H: Where H is made up of <V,E>
                                            Convert the undirected edges in E to pairs of directed edges. So an undirected edge {{A,B}} turns into the directed pair of edges {(A,B),(B,A)} 
                                            Then turn every node into a pair of nodes denoted by 0 and 1. So a node 'A' turns into the two nodes '<A,0>' and '<A,1>'
                                            Now looks at the pairs of edges in E and maps from 1 to 0. So an edge (A,B) turns into (<A,1>, <B,0>) and edge (B,A) becomes (<B,1>,<A,0>)
                                            Then add directed edges from every 0 node 'u' to 1 node 'u'. ie. creates edges from <A,0> to <A,1>, <B,0> to <B,1> â€¦ <Z,0> to <Z,1>
                                            Now the algorithm has created an ARCSET instance (in other words, a Digraph). ";
